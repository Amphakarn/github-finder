# Github Finder

Github Finder is a React app to search Github profiles and drill down into user details and repositories. This app uses Github REST API to create calls to get the specific data. I started off building this application in class based components and stateless functional components, then refactored to functional components using hooks like useState, useEffect. useReducer and useContext.
